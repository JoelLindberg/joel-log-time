Python SQLite:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html

*"The sqlite3 module was written by Gerhard HÃ¤ring. It provides an SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by PEP 249"*

Python MySQL:

Apparently this driver is following the Python DB API 2.0 standard referenced above. This makes SQLite and MySQL very interchangeable for Python.

## sqlite

I will go with sqlite for now. Since both the mysql driver and python's sqlite library use the same Python DB 2.0 API it should be easy to switch later. I could also program some kind of encapsulation with an interface to allow an easy update later if I want to move to MySQL.
